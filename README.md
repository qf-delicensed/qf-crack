hi i havent touched java before doing this so spare me some slack

# compiling it yourself if you don't wanna download the release
ok so like if you wanna "compile" it yourself you can download original qf from
          
                                                    v remember this long number for verifying its from qf and not my ratted mods folder
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019842915951988746/1054420826084098058/qf-obfuscated-skip.jar or my file mirror on the github, 

**incase you say the discord download link is a rat you can verify its from qf since typing <#1019842915951988746> in qf's #general chat will actually spit out a channel called #☕・download-mod [the channel is also featured in nevo's tutorial at the end https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj3n1ZroUvw]**

alright, now you wanna go ahead and download the open source class file from the github, look through it with recaf if you are 
still on edge, after that just open qf in winrar and drag my funny class file over and save it with a different name [preferably] and youre done
